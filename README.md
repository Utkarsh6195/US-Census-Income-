# Census Income Classification Project ðŸ§®ðŸ’»
- A data-driven project to predict whether an individualâ€™s income exceeds $50K/year based on U.S. Census data. This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning model building. ðŸš€

## ðŸ›  Key Skills & Tools
- Data Preprocessing: Missing values, outlier treatment, and SMOTE for imbalanced data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Insights through visualizations ðŸ“Š (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Feature Engineering: Categorical consolidation and Label Encoding.
- Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression ðŸ¤–
Decision Tree ðŸŒ³
Random Forest ðŸŒ² (Best: 82% Accuracy, Precision, F1-Score)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning: Handled nulls, duplicates, and outliers.
- EDA: Analyzed income-impacting features (education, work hours, age).
- Feature Engineering: Simplified categories for interpretability.
- Modeling: Trained models, evaluated performance, and balanced datasets.
- Results: Random Forest achieved optimal performance. ðŸ”¥
